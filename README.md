## Disclaimer

This document refers to *me* and how *I* comport myself, and not to any specific employer, though I and my team will do best in an environment where I can behave as described below.

## Purpose


## TL;DR


## About Me as a Human

### What Do I Value?

- awareness of privilege, especially mine
- acceptance does not require approval
- mental and physical health are important
- down time
- family
- being on time

### My Life

### My Personality

Things that tend to be mostly good:



Things that tend to be mostly problematic:

- If I'm not careful, I will overthink things and dig myself into a perfectionist hole.
- I can let myself get spread too thin.
- when I'm tired I can be *extremely* distractable.

### Pet Peeves

- not learning from mistakes
- not having the will to apply what we learn from mistakes
- not having a plan, or ten plans
- making a habit of crisis


### What Boxes Do I Fit Into?

- In the DISC Plus test, I score very high on S (Stability) and very, very high on C (Cautious), and pretty low on D (Decisive) and I (Interactive).  My Aesthetic and Theoretical values are very high, my Economic and Individualistic values are very low, and the rest are middling.  This implies that I'm deliberate, agreeable, matter-of-fact, a bit reserved, loyal, patient, cautious, and process-oriented.  This is largely accurate. 

## What to Expect of Me as a Manager

### What Is My Job?

We both work for a company, and have responsibilities we must execute to further the company's aims.  There are parts of our jobs that will fall out directly from that, whether we like it or not.  I will try to make that as smooth for both of us as possible.

I believe that my job as a manager is to:

- Hire amazing people to meet the needs of the company.
- Help those people grow in ways that benefit at least them if not me, too.
- Give them the context to understand what I and the company expect of them, and why.
- Provide them the tools and learning opportunities to do the best job they can to meet those expectations.
- Actively clear up roadblocks that would get in their way.

Every single one of those points is about people.  It should be.

My job *is not*:

- Telling you how to do things, unless you ask.
- Pushing you to meet a corporate bottom line; if we did it right, that should fall out of the points above.
- Making anyone's job harder unless the alternative is to make it harder-er.


### What Do I Value?

- people
- diversity
- collaboration
- growth
- leaving the tech ecosystem better than I found it
- honesty
- trust, including telling me when too much is asked of you
- kindness
- efficiency
- 'good' being good enough
- 'good enough' never being good enough
- metrics, except when I don't
- being on time (it's okay if you're not if you let me know)

### What Don't I Value?

- Degrees; well, I *do* value them, because they demonstrate the skills needed to earn a degree, but my best employees have either not had degrees, or had them in fields unrelated to their jobs with me.
- meetings that could be e-mails
- e-mails that could IM conversations

### How Did I Get into Management?


### Work Style

- favor autonomy in team members; I prefer to be pretty hands-off, ask me ASAP if you need more
- strong grip on a loose rein; steer with the knees
- I trust you to know more than I do about the work
- default to transparency, unless I legally can't; I cannot be asked to lie to you
- I may not answer you, but I won't lie to you
- I try to remove obstacles, not create them
- you *are* my job, I am (almost) always here for you first
- I like process that builds good habits and stays out of the way, I will tinker with process to make it more efficient, and I will encourage you to do so, too

### Things I Am Not Good At

- delegation
- keeping work at work

### Typical Hours and Work/Life Balance

The company we work for may have other ideas, but absent those I would expect you to work roughly 9am to 5pm in your local time zone, but as long as you're getting your work done -- including meetings you need to attend and availability for the people you work with -- and you can let me know about your needs in advance I'm willing to be very flexible.  I will try very hard to keep you not working more than forty hours a week.  If you're sick, please don't work; remind me of this when I try to work while sick.  Take vacation.

If I contact you by any means after hours, I do not expect a response, and I will probably tell you in my message when I'd prefer one.  Please don't respond immediately unless I clearly indicate that I'd like you to (and even then I will probably not expect you to).  In general I should let you know well in advance if I expect you to be on call in any way.  That said, you can reach out to me any time, and I will try to respond when I notice it, or I'll set a reminder to do so; if you do contact me after hours, please do so by IM or e-mail.

### Preferred Communication Channel(s)

Speaking of, my preferred communication media, in order:

- Slack/IM
- E-mail
- Voice chat
- Video chat

It's not that I won't like talking with you, it's that I am usually multiplexing, and it's hard to take the time to focus on a single thread, and in my experience in a distributed company people are bad at noticing one is busy and waiting to engage.  If we're being honest I'm also sometimes a little avoidant of the degree of focus that a voice or video conversation brings with it.  Asynchronous communication is something I'm usually very comfortable with, though for 1:1 conversations I prefer Slack or voice -- those are typically the only meetings that I ignore everything else for.

### Growing People

this job is likely just one stop along your path



### Goals and Accountability


### How I Usually Spend My Work Day


### If You Are My Employee...

#### 1:1s

- unless there are a lot of you, we'll start with half an hour weekly, and adjust to what works; not always needed, but nice to have the time set aside.
- conversations about goals (qv) and performance reviews will probably be longer.
- I may have things I want to discuss, but you own the agenda for these conversations.  they can be, but these are not required to be status meetings.  Slack/IM is better for status anyway.
- Also I will try to not wait for a 1:1 for important feedback.  1:1s are for catching up and nurturing our relationship.
- I'm probably in a lot of meetings but you will have dibs to any time not already booked, and can probably pre-empt my time if it is already booked.  My calendar is *usually* current.
- You can always reach out over IM.
